This means that end-users can document their feedback using text input, audio recording, ratings and screenshot annotations. The developed solution is available for Android and web applications and deployed on the SUPERSEDE platform.\r\n\r\nThe feedback gathering and the monitoring tool is composed by seven components:\r\n\r\n- *Android Library*: Android library to include feedback gathering mechanisms in an Android application ([README.md](https://github.com/supersede-project/monitor_feedback/blob/master/android_library/README.md))\r\n- *Monitor Manager*: (https://github.com/supersede-project/monitor_feedback/tree/master/monitor_manager)\r\n- *Monitors*: This project contains the set of implemented monitors (RESTful web services) for the feedback gathering project ([README.md](https://github.com/supersede-project/monitor_feedback/blob/master/monitors/README.md))\r\n- *Orchestrator*: Is a RESTfull Web API that provides endpoints for storing, receiving and updating the feedback configuration ([README.md](https://github.com/supersede-project/monitor_feedback/blob/master/orchestrator/README.md))\r\n- *Reporting Frontend*: This is an Angular2 application that serves as a frontend for the repository. It allows to view and manage submitted feedbacks ([README.md](https://github.com/supersede-project/monitor_feedback/blob/master/reporting_frontend/README.md))\r\n- *Repository*: Is a RESTfull Web API that provides endpoints for storing, receiving and deleting user feedbacks ([README.md](https://github.com/supersede-project/monitor_feedback/blob/master/repository/README.md))\r\n- *Web Library*: jQuery Plugin to include Feedback Gathering on a Website ([README.md](https://github.com/supersede-project/monitor_feedback/blob/master/web_library/README.md))\r\n\r\n*Please check the respective README.md for details.*\r\n\r\nMain contact: Norbert Seyff <norbert.seyff@fhnw.ch>\r\n\r\n![Project funded by the European Union](images/european.union.logo.png)  ",
